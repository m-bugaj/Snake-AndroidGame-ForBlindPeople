# Hungry Snake üêç

Hungry Snake is a classic Snake game for Android with added accessibility features such as Text-to-Speech (TTS) support, allowing visually impaired users to enjoy the game.

## Overview

Hungry Snake is a simple yet addictive game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food (represented by "Bob" in the game). The snake moves around the screen, and the player must navigate it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

### Features

- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Responsive touch controls for easy navigation.
- Accessibility features with Text-to-Speech (TTS) support for visually impaired users.
- Dynamic difficulty scaling based on the snake's length and movement speed.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.

## Installation

To install Hungry Snake on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Download the APK file from the repository's [releases page](link_to_releases).
2. Enable installation from unknown sources in your device's settings.
3. Open the downloaded APK file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the game.
4. Once installed, you can find Hungry Snake on your device's home screen or app drawer.

## Usage

- **Starting a New Game**: Launch the game from your device's home screen. Upon starting, you'll hear the game announce "Starting the game."
- **Gameplay Controls**: Use touch controls to change the snake's direction. Clicking your finger on the left or right side of the screen will rotate the snake accordingly.
- **Earning Points**: Eat the food (Bob) by guiding the snake to its location. Each successful consumption earns the player points, with the score announced via Text-to-Speech.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Upon game over, the game restarts automatically.

## Origin

Hungry Snake was initially developed as a project for a university laboratory. Originally, the Snake game did not include accessibility features. As part of the assignment, I was tasked with implementing these features to allow visually impaired individuals to play the game.
